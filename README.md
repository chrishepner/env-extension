# Environment Notification Extension

This is a Chrome extension that displays a banner when the URL of the current page matches a specified substring or
regular expression.

I wrote this because, as a developer, I frequently switch between development and production
environments and would like a visible warning before I publish "LOL BUTTS TESTING123" on the public website of my employer.

## Use

To specify a list of URLs to display the banner on and other settings, go to the
[Chrome Extensions page](chrome://extensions) and click the Options link under the extension.
